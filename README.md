# About the Snippets

There are two types of snippets. The first are built-in modules such as the search module and the ddr menu.

The second type are skin tokens. These are small bits of code you can put on your page to render database-level details about the page you are on. For example: `<%=PortalSettings.ActiveTab.TabName %>` will output the name of the page you are on.
